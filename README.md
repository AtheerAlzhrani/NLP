 # Project4: Arabic_Text_Cleaning
**Arabic Text Cleaning Using Offensive Language Detection Dataset**

*Objective:* The project focuses on cleaning Arabic text data to prepare it for analysis or model training. It utilizes the Arabic_Offensive_Comment_Detection dataset available on HuggingFace.

*Dataset:* The dataset is designed for detecting offensive language and includes Arabic news comments. It provides a rich source of text data for the purpose of identifying and filtering offensive content.

**Steps Involved:**

* Data Cleaning: Apply text preprocessing techniques to remove irrelevant or noisy elements from the dataset. This includes tasks like removing non-Arabic characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
* Text Processing: Address additional processing tasks such as removing stop words and stemming words to standardize and normalize the text data.
